# Django REST API Note-taker
 
### Simple API created using Django and a library called TastyPie.

Used this project for learning the use of Django in basic REST APIs and CRUD operations.
The goal was building a REST-ful API with the CRUD endpoints, to create, read, update, and delete notes.
The good news is that rather than approach these endpoints individually, Django lets us more or less create them all in one.
You can use this app to play with the functionalities of Postman (make sure you use JSON)
